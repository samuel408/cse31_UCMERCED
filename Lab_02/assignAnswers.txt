1. What line caused the segmentation fault? 
2. How do you fix the line so it works properly? 
 
You can recompile the code and run the program again. The program now reads all the input values but the 
average calculated is still incorrect. Use GDB to fix the program by looking at the output of 
read_values. To do this, either set a breakpoint using the line number or set a breakpoint in the 
read_values function. Then continue executing till the end of the function and view the values being 
returned. Answer the following questions (in the text file assignAnswers.txt as mentioned above): 
3. What is the bug here?  
4. How do you fix it? 

1. Run the program with the following input: “HELLO!” for str1 and “hello!” for str2. Is the output 
expected? 
string needs more memory for the 0 at the end
2. Do not stop the program, enter “HI!” for str1 and “hi!” for str2. Is the output expected? What is 
the bug here? Try to fix the program so it will print the output correctly. 
there isn't enough memory alocation for the zero and the opposite happens for small
3. Do not stop the program, enter “Hello! How are you?” for str1 and “I am fine, thank 
you!” for str2. Is the output expected?  Why do you think this happens? You do not need to fix 
this. 
making  the memory location available  where the previous phrase was stored?
